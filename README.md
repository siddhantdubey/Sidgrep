# Sidgrep

## Why?

I built this because I wanted to play around with OpenAI's new embedding model, build a personal search engine of some sort, and because I thought it would make a good YouTube video.
The code isn't really meant to be a starter template or anything, but if you want to use it to start your own project, the next few sections 
should help you do that fairly easily.

## Getting The Data



## Hosting The Data 



## Running The Project After Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
